                    Just a heads up. I'm probably not going to fill up most of this blog page.
                    As most of the things I keep for work related purposes are held in my Portfolial.
                    I will link that below this.
                </p>
                <button className='btn' to='https://seanbelon.portfolial.com/#/'>Link to My Work</button>
            </div>
        </section>
    )

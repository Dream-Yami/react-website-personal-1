                    Hiya! My name is Sean Allen D Belon.
                    As you can probably see, I'm really into indie video games. Currently obsessing over games like "Oneshot" or "Undertale Yellow" atm.
                    I play some multiplayer games but that rarely happens with projects and stuff I run to fill up my resume.
                    {"\n"}{"\n"}
                    My declared major is in computer science and I have high interest in the AI/ML field.
                    Please don't judge this website too hard as I have rarely coded in JS before and had never touched the React Framework.
                    That and the fact that I only spent around a good part of the day completing all of this.
                </text>
            </div>
        </section>
